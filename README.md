## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- pnpm (recommended) or npm

### Quick Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd hello-world
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Run the setup script:
```bash
pnpm run setup
```
This will create `.env.local` from the example and guide you through the setup.

4. Edit `.env.local` with your actual values (at minimum, add a NextAuth secret):
```bash
# Generate a secret for NextAuth
openssl rand -base64 32
```

5. After editing .env.local, set up the database:
```bash
pnpm run db:setup
```

6. Run the development server:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up manually:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd hello-world
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```
Edit `.env.local` and add your actual values. At minimum, generate a NextAuth secret:
```bash
# Generate a secret for NextAuth
openssl rand -base64 32
```

4. Set up the database:
```bash
pnpm run db:setup
```

5. Run the development server:
```bash
