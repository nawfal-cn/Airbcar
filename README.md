# Hello World Next.js App

This is a simple Next.js project that displays "Hello World" on the screen. The project was created with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) and styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- Next.js 15.3.5 with JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS v4 for styling
- App Router architecture
- Clean, minimal "Hello World" display
- pnpm package manager

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
